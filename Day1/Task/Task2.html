        <!-- Background and Reason for the Strike -->
        <p id="para">
            The <span class="highlight">Balakot Airstrike</span> was a significant military action conducted by the Indian Air Force on February 26, 2019. This operation was in response to the Pulwama attack that occurred on February 14, 2019, where a suicide bomber targeted an Indian paramilitary convoy, killing 40 personnel.

            <br><br>

            The Indian government blamed the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based militant group, for the Pulwama attack. As a retaliatory measure, Indian fighter jets carried out airstrikes on a JeM training camp located in <span class="highlight">Balakot</span>, Pakistan.
            <br><br>
        <!-- The Operation -->
        In the early hours of February 26, Indian Mirage 2000 fighter jets crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and bombed the target site at Balakot. The operation lasted for a few minutes and was hailed as a pre-emptive strike to neutralize terrorist threats.
            <br><br>
        <!-- Outcome and Reactions -->
        The Indian government claimed that several militants, including high-profile commanders of Jaish-e-Mohammed, were killed in the strike. However, Pakistan disputed this, stating that no casualties occurred and the Indian jets had only damaged forest areas. The international community, including the United Nations, urged both countries to show restraint.</p>
